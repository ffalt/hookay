# Hookay Frontend

A static frontend version is included into each hookay release, so you can skip this if you don't want to develop it.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Calls to the backend are proxied from `http://localhost:4200/` to `http://localhost:8181/`

## Build

Run `npm build` to build the project. 

## Build Deploy

Run `npm build:deploy` to build the project in production mode into `../dist/static`
